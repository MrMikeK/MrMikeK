Hello!  My name is Mike K and I am a data enthusiast.  My day job is to teach high school math - I sometimes also teach social studies, and I'm certified to be a school counselor.  But lately I've been honing my data science skills.  

My most recent accomplishment is to have completed the Data Science Specialization offered by Johns Hopkins University via Coursera.  The Capstone project was to create a word predictor, but the 10-course specialization covered everything from obtaining and cleaning data to producing visuals to tell a data story.  This specialization focuses on R but I also completed Data Camp's Intermediate Python program.

My interests include social science data, sports data and teaching.  I am currently exploring Kaggle, making an app for my Father-in-Law's favorite TV show, and making my word predictor faster.

You can reach me at datafan1618@gmail.com - I'd love to connect!
